Just my common dot files...

#### Submodules ####
There are a few vim bundles that are included as git submodules. If you clone this repository with the standard git clone <url> then the submodules will need to be downloaded too. 

```
git clone <this repository>
<cd into repository>
git submodule update --init
```

Alternatively, you can add the --recursive flag to the git clone command to download them with this repository. 

```git clone <this repository>> --recursive``
